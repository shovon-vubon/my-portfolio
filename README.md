this project is a automatic sun position detecting project that actually reads the real time using rtc then it converts the time to sun position of that place for that particular period. According to that uno is programmed to move the servo motor to which the solar panel is attached.
thereby the panel moves towards  the sun within the time,
hence maximum sunlight is ensured by the panel.
this is how my automatic solar panel works with algorithm not using LDR
